### Notes
I had to reinstall the app as I was making it when I got to the part where I first had to use AsyncHttpClient in order to avoid an error. It took me some time to figure out how to change the app icon and how to make the placeholder image readable to Android (converting SVG to XML). I changed the theme of the app from the default white with a purple header to a black theme.
The placeholder image was made by me. The app icon I used, ["Movie, music, player, video icon"](https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/1564536/movie_music_player_video_icon) by [Artyom Khamitov](https://www.iconfinder.com/Kh.Artyom) is licensed under [CC BY 3.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). The app icon art is cropped from the original in different ways depending on if round or square icons are being used.

### Open-source libraries used
